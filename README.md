## The task is to reach a test accuracy of 80% on CIFAR-10 dataset using advanced convolutions and some of the constraints(mentioned below) in this model to acheive the 80% accuracy are as below
## 1. Total Receptive Field must be more than 44
## 2. Total parameters to be less than 1 Million
## 3. Use Depthwise Separable Convolutions
## 4. Use Dilated Convolutions
